# Volume Visualizer

[Link](https://volume-visualizer.vercel.app/)

A website that helps visualize solids of revolution, 3D objects created by rotating the area between two function around an axis. Created as a culminating project for MCV4U.

The 3D visualization was originally written in three.js ([link to repo](https://github.com/bearatron/volume-visualizer-threejs)) before being translated to React Three Fiber.
